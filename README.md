# Passworst (formerly passrust): The Worst Password Manager

## [Download](https://github.com/fr000gs/passrust/releases)

## Usage

1. Enter your username in top field (along with the website name)
2. Enter your master password below
3. Copy the hash generated into the password

## How does it work?

1. Each combination of username, website and master password is hashed to make a UNIQUE password
2. Even if the password is leaked the person who gets the password cannot get your master password

## Advantages

1. You no longer have to click the "forgot password" button
2. You don't have to carry around a file unlike other password managers
